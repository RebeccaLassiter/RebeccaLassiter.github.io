      <p class = "bio"> Hello there! I am a sophomore studying Computer Science at Northwestern University.  I am currently interested
        in Tangible Interaction Design and Embodied Computing--exploring how we can create user interfaces that utilize
        greater physical or full-body interaction. If you want to learn more about me and my work, check out my Projects
        page and the Miscellaneous Interests below!

      <img src = "Pie.png" class = "miscPics"/>
      <p> Have I ever made a pie? No. Is pie the mega-ultimate-supreme food? Yes.
        Savory, sweet, fruity, creamy--pie is truly the Leonardo De Vinci of the
        Pastry World. </p>

    <div class = "col-xs-3 col-md-3 miscTiles">
      <img src = "NUCHR.jpg" class = "miscPics"/>
      <p> Northwestern University Community for Human Rights. Also known as THE
      premier human rights group on campus. Check out our annual conference in January
    (this year's theme=Human Rights and Cities).  </p>

    <div class = "col-xs-3 col-md-3 miscTiles">
      <img src = "podcast.png" class = "miscPics"/>
      <p> Podcasts! Everyone's favorite media form. Listen while folding clothes!
      Listen while walking to class! Listen while eating alone in the dining hall!
      (It's not sad. I promise.) Rough Translation and Radiolab are two favorites of mine. </p>

      <img src = "Byzantine.jpeg" class = "miscPics"/>
      <p> The Byzantine Empire is one of the least appreciated empires out there.
      This Eastern Roman Empire thrived for almost 1000 additional years after the
      fall of Rome. Justinian's Corpus Juris, the Hagia Sophia, Greek Fire--what's not to love? </p>

      <img src = "NC.png" class = "miscPics"/>
      <p> North Carolina is my home! Here you can find some of the best Barbecue
        and Sweet Tea around. I especially love to hike in our lovely Appalachain
        Mountains.  </p>

      <p> Yellow has been my favorite color since Day One. Put simply, it is the
      color of happiness. Put complexly, it is found on the spectrum of visible light with a
       frequency between 508-526 THz. Either way, how could you not be a fan?  </p>
